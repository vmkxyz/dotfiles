There are a few scripts/binaries here, I do not take any responsibility for what happens when you run these on your system, please note that running scripts you don't understand made by other people on the internet may not be the best idea.

I do not recommend trying to run the following scripts in the first place as these are either a work-in-progress, broken, obsolete, depricated, useless or dangerous:
- z_install.sh
- rnd_wall_hpp

v_rust and rnd_wall_hpp_rust are binaries written in rust, these will soon become obsolete for the following reasons:
- v_rust is just v rewritten into rust, however it' so short and simple that there is no reason for it not to be a just shell script
- rnd_wall_hpp_rust is specificly made for hyprland, hyprpaper and wallust, which I don't really use that much now, also its pretty poorly written and slow
