these are my dotfiles

I use Arch btw (with hyprland and waybar)
there might be configs for different WMs but I probably havent touched those in a long time
actually there might be configs for more stuff that I dont actually use idk

everything is also mirrored on my gitlab (https://gitlab.com/vmkxyz/dotfiles/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads)
(I hope the link works)

if you'll actually use some of my dotfiles, you may consider starring this repo, it will make me happy :) thank youu

I also stole some parts of my configs from other poeple, they are probably mentioned in the individual dotfiles, but I guess I should also mention the here:
github: @LukeSmithxyz; @SSKT7;
gitlab: Stephan Raabe; @Zaney; 
and probably a lot of random people on youtube, reddit etc.
