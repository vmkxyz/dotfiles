# My Dotfiles

The READMEs are kinda a mess...

Welcome, these are my dotfiles. I run Arch linux (btw) as my distro ~~with Hyprland as my WM/compositor.~~ Kinda, I am trying out a few different compositors rn, my current favourite is dwl, I have my fork of it on my github profile (not yet liar). Feel free to edit and use anything here you find useful.

## What's in Here

- **Configs for multiple WMs:** River, Hypeland, Qtile
- **Some forks:** Ok those are in other repos, but I have my builds of dwl, slstatus, wmenu and more
- **Neovim Configs:** For a better coding experience. (Or just text editing...)
- **Firefox `user.js`:** With some sane options and privacy in mind!
- **Scripts:** Some of them even in [**Rust**](https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM?t=74)! (Rust source code in the [sc](sc/) directory.)
- **And Much More:** Like firefox userChrome.css and configs for many more programs.
