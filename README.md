# My Dotfiles

Welcome, these are my dotfiles. Feel free to use anything you like here.
This repo is also mirrored on [my GitLab] for reasons...

## Programs I use

- **os: arch**
- **WM/compositor:** *[dwl]*
- **statusbar:** [dwl-bar-0.7] + *[slstatus]*
- **terminal:** foot
- **menu:** rofi and *[wmenu]*
- **editor:** neovim
- **browser:** firefox ([user.js])
- **shell:** zsh

I also have configs for River, Hyprland and Qtile. These might be a bit out-of-date tho.
I have my own firefox [user.js] which borrows from [Betterfox] and [Arkenfox] and has a few other changes made to it.
Some usefull scripts can be found at [.local/bin/]
Any forks can be found on my profile.
