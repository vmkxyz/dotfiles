These are my dotfiles.

I have a thinkpad that I run Arch on (btw). I use Hyprlnad with waybar. <br>
You can also find some cool Neovim configs, my own firefox user.js made with privacy in mind, some scripts you might find usefull and a lot more.

Currently, there are also all of my wallpapers here; but I plan to move those to a differend repo in the future.

everything is also mirrored on [my gitlab](https://gitlab.com/vmkxyz/dotfiles/-/tree/master?ref_type=heads)

I also ~~stole~~ borrowed some parts of other poeple's configs, some of them might mentioned in the individual dotfiles, but I guess I should also mention the here: <br>
github: LukeSmithxyz; agryphus; SSKT7; fishyfishfish55; adi1090x; xsghetti <br>
gitlab: Stephan Raabe; Zaney; <br>
and probably a lot of random people on youtube, reddit etc.

If you'll like or actually use some of my dotfiles, you can star this repo, it will make me happy :) thank you.
