# My Dotfiles

Welcome, these are my dotfiles. I run Arch linux (btw) as my distro with Hyprland as my WM. Feel free to edit and use anything here you might find useful.

## What's in Here

- **Hyprland and Waybar Configs:** With wallpaper based colors all over the place.
- **Neovim Configs:** For a better coding experience. (Or just text editing...)
- **Firefox `user.js`:** With some sane options and privacy in mind!
- **Scripts:** Some of them even in [**Rust**](https://youtu.be/LDU_Txk06tM?si=XyNZZpBwhdSF4-0Z&t=74)! (Rust source code in tge [sc](sc/) directory.)
- **And Much More:** Like firefox useChrome.css and configs for many more programs.

## Mirror
